The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, is completed within time and cost estimates, and is maintainable. Here are the basics of SDLC:

### 1.Planning: 
This initial phase involves defining project goals, scope, procedures, and the overall plan for the software development process.
### 2.Requirement Analysis: 
In this stage, detailed requirements of the software are gathered from stakeholders, and an analysis is conducted to prepare for the next phase.
### 3.Design: 
The software’s architecture is designed, outlining the software’s overall structure, including database design, user interface design, and more.
### 4.Implementation: 
The actual coding of the software takes place during this phase. Developers follow the design documents to build the code.
### 5.Testing: 
The software is rigorously tested to find and fix any bugs or issues. This ensures that the software’s quality meets the required standards.
### 6.Deployment: 
Once the software is tested and ready, it is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to users.
### 7.Maintenance: 
After deployment, the software will require maintenance to handle any new issues, updates, or improvements.


#### Different models of SDLC include the Waterfall Model, Iterative Model, Spiral Model, V-Model, and Big Bang Model. Each model has its unique approach to software development and is chosen based on the project’s needs.
